# mnist-tensorflowjs

This demo uses the [tensorflowjs](https://js.tensorflow.org/) library. The training dataset is stored in batches as png images such as [this](http://mnistdemo.tweeny.in/mnist_data/mnist_batch_0.png). One such batch includes 3000 images. The script [unpack_mnist.py](https://github.com/tweenyapp/mnist-tensorflowjs/blob/master/unpack_mnist.py) was used to extract the images from training data downloaded from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
